# Sentiment-Intensity-Analyzer
#  Sentimental_analysis_sia.ipynb

Objective: This notebook performs sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in text data. It utilizes the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer (SIA) from the NLTK library, which is specifically designed for sentiment analysis in social media text.
Libraries Used:

pandas and numpy: For data manipulation.

nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit, which provides tools for working with text data.

matplotlib and seaborn: For visualization.

Key Steps:

Data Loading:

Loads the text data from a file (e.g., CSV). The data could be customer reviews, tweets, or any other text corpus.

NLTK Setup:

Downloads necessary NLTK resources (if not already present), such as punkt (for tokenization) and vader_lexicon (the sentiment lexicon used by SIA).

Sentiment Intensity Analysis:

Creates an instance of SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.

Applies the analyzer to each piece of text in the dataset.

SIA calculates sentiment scores:

Positive Score: The proportion of the text that is positive.

Negative Score: The proportion of the text that is negative.

Neutral Score: The proportion of the text that is neutral.

Compound Score: A single score that summarizes the overall sentiment, ranging from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).

Sentiment Classification (Potentially):

Based on the compound score, the text can be classified into sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). You might define thresholds for the compound score to make these classifications.

Results Analysis and Visualization:

Analyzes the distribution of sentiment scores.

Visualizes the sentiment (e.g., using histograms, bar charts).

May involve looking at examples of text with different sentiment scores.

Key Concepts:

Sentiment Lexicon: A dictionary that maps words to their sentiment scores. SIA uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon, which is particularly tailored for social media.

Tokenization: The process of breaking down text into individual words or units (tokens).

Compound Score: A normalized, weighted composite score that provides an overall measure of sentiment intensity.

Negation Handling: SIA is designed to handle some aspects of negation (e.g., "not good" is recognized as negative).

Conjunctions and Intensifiers: SIA also takes into account the impact of conjunctions (e.g., "but") and intensifiers (e.g., "very") on sentiment.
